5.Streamlit

6.Plotly

**Domain**: Fintech


**Problem Statement**
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a vast amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The objective is to extract this data, process it, and create an interactive dashboard to visualize the insights in a user-friendly manner.

**Approach**

1.Data Extraction: Clone the GitHub repository to fetch the data.

2.Data Transformation: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data using Python and Pandas.

3.Database Insertion: Store the transformed data in a MySQL database.

4.Dashboard Creation: Use Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard.

5.Data Retrieval: Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.

6.Deployment: Deploy the solution securely and efficiently.


**Results**

The project will deliver a live geo visualization dashboard with at least 10 dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures. The dashboard will provide valuable insights from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and dynamically update with the latest data.
